# ClimateFinder

#####
This automation project was intended to use a 3rd party API via openweathermap. In doing so, I created an application that allowed the user to submit an input of a city that they wanted climate information about. In return, my application would reflect those results from the requested cities. This idea to use a weather API was gifted by Tech With Tim, none of this would've been possible without him.
